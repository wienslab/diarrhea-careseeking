Chikwawa has an average monthly temperature of 28.4 °C, with a minimum of 15.2 °C and a maximum of 45.6 °C. It is normally hot and humid in the months of November to April and hot, dusty and very dry in the months of July to November. Average rainfall in Chikwawa is around 915 mm/year, mostly falling in November–March [2]. Malawi’s biggest river, which drains Lake Malawi and is characterised by big marshes, passes through this district. Almost every year, Chikwawa is faced with floods from the Shire River and others that feeds into it. The flooding sweeps away crops and livestock thereby creating food insecurity responsible for malnutrition to many children. They also sweep away human dwellings, displacing hundreds of people. Floods leave behind marshes and other pools of water.

The climate is subtropical, with a rainy season that runs from November through April. There is little to no rainfall throughout most of the district from May to October. Chikwawa has an average monthly temperature of 28.4 °C, with a minimum of 15.2 °C and a maximum of 45.6 °C. It is normally hot and humid in the months of November to April and hot, dusty and very dry in the months of July to November. Average rainfall in Chikwawa is around 915 mm/year, mostly falling in November–March [2]. Malawi’s biggest river, which drains Lake Malawi and is characterised by big marshes, passes through this district. Almost every year, Chikwawa is faced with floods from the Shire River and others that feeds into it. The flooding sweeps away crops and livestock thereby creating food insecurity responsible for malnutrition to many children. They also sweep away human dwellings, displacing hundreds of people. Floods leave behind marshes and other pools of water.
